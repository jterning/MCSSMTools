!   We use 'gmake' options in our Makefiles. If you do not have 'gmake' 
!   then more likely your  'make'  is identical to 'gmake'.


I. General  installation.
   Launch
       [g]make 

   It should generate files with compilers flags
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForMake
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh
   
   and  compile  
       CalcHEP_src/bin/s_calchep 
       sources/micromegas.a

   Possible problems are discussed in Section VII below. 

   micromegas_2.1 was tested for  Linux, OSF1, SunOS, Darwin, 
   Cygwin.
 
II. To work with MSSN, MSSM, CPVMSSM, LHM, RHNM  models
    go to the corresponding directory. 

    To generate executable use
     [g]make main=<source file>
                                                          
    <source file> is expected to be a C  (.c) file, C++ (.cpp) one,
     or a Fortran (.F) file.

    The list of functions you can use in  your programs is described in 
    hep-ph/0405253, hep-ph/0607059 and  arXiv:0803.2360[hep-ph].

 *** Cygwin user has to launch executable with 
    ../cgwRun <exe with parameters>

III. Each model directory  contains 2 sample  files: 
      main.c 
      main.F
      a sample for C++  can be obtained by 'cp main.c main.cpp'
 
     main.c and main.F  contain  several independent modules 
     which can be switched ON  by '#define' preprocessor instructions
     in the top of the file.

     The modules are:

   a) MASSES_INFO
       displays mass spectrum for odd particles (super partners) and 
       Higgs particles;
   b) CONSTRAINTS
       checks experimental  constraints;  
   c) OMEGA
       computes the relic density;
   d) INDIRECT_DETECTION
       calculates  WIMP annihilation spectra and integrate
       over halo profile;
   e) RESET_FORMFACTORS
       resets parameters of nucleon form factors, DM velocity 
       distribution, and nucleus Fermi density;
   f) WIMP_NUCLEON
       calculates WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering amplitudes
   g) WIMP_NUCLEUS
       calculates the number of events for 1day&1kg  of detector material and 
       recoil energy distribution for WINP-nuclei reaction;
   h) CROSS_SECTIONS
       calculates different  widths and cross sections

IV. Each model directory contains a subdirectory  'calchep/' intended 
    for calculation of different cross sections and decay widths 
    in  interactive sessions  for SM and other models.  
        
V.To implement new model.  Launch 
    ./newProject  <project name>
      
 Then directory <project name> will be created with all needed subdirectories 
 and  sample  files inside. Further instructions can be found in local 
 README file. 
      
VI. To clean all generated files use 
   [g]make clean 
      or  
   ./clean 
   launched from micromegas_2.1 directory. In each model directory you 
   can call 
     [g]make clean 
   to remove all generated files in this particular directory.

VII. Compilers and  their Flags
    Options for compilation are stored in two files FlagsForSh and 
    FlagsForMake  that should contain identical settings presented 
    in different formats. These files are located in the CalcHEP_src 
    directory and initiated by the getFlags command launched from 
    the  same directory. 

    If FlagsForSh does not exist, getFlags creates it according to the 
    operation system name returned by the 'uname' Unix command.
    If FlagsForSh exists, getFlags reads all parameters  from this 
    file, checks and  modifies them if it needs, and writes down 
    new FlagsForSh and FlagsForMake. It also informs you in case of 
    problem.
   
    In case of problem the user can change compiler flags 
    written in  FlagsForSh and launch getFlags  again until
    it will finish without error code and FagsForMake will be generated.
    The meaning of all flags is explained in the FlagsForSh file.
