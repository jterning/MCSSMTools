 This license is  for distribution of CalcHEP and various models
 of particle interaction which were developed for CalcHEP. Such models
 typically use several scientific packages and so I have to
 re-distribute programs written by other people.  In the same time  I
 consider CalcHEP as a calculator of matrix elements which in its turn
 can be included into other scientific packages.

           Non-profit Use License Agreement
           --------------------------------

 0. This license is written  for distribution of scientific software.
    It is assumed that such software is published in
    scientific journals and will be  used  for further academic studies
    or education.  The including of given software into another packages or
    its use for education   needs permission for redistribution and such
    permission is provided by this license.


 1. This license touches only non-profit use and distribution  and does
    not permit any  commercial re-licensing or re-distributions. In particular,
    you  get this package free of charge.


 2. The license permits you to copy, use, re-distribute CalcHEP package
    and  software which supports models of particle interactions  for
    CalcHEP as well as  to include them into another packages with their
    further  distribution under the following conditions:

  a) any re-distribution has to be accompanied with a file which contains
     the list  of scientific publications which present the given package
     as well as  all its parts. This file also has to contain the list of
     WWW sites where  original versions  of this package  and  original
     versions  of  its parts are disposed.

  b) redistributing the package you have a right to change installation
     routines,  improve compiler dependent parts of the code, and  change
     interface  routines. But modification of codes that change scientific
     results produced by the package or  some its part are not permitted
     by this license.


 3. This License states  that all included programs are  presented
    as they were written by their authors,  except  changes described
    in point 2(b).  All publications presenting  these programs as well
    as addresses of WWW sites which distribute original versions are written
    in file CITE which is included in any  distributed *.tgz archive. (*)


 *)  You can also get corresponding information about  CalcHEP pressing
   the F9 key.  Information about each model is also  stored into the
   "Libraries" model item as a comment.
