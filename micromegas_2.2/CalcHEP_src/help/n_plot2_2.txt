3 5 50 Plot
 The calculated values of the function will be
written to a file plot_#.txt. After that a message
about the file name will appear on the screen.
 
 The generated file can be used to reproduce plot 
via CalcHEP  facilities :
       $CALCHEP/bin/plot_view < plot_#.txt
Also it contains PAW commands commented by #PAW.
These commands can be moved to a PAW script for 
subsequent visualization of the plot.
