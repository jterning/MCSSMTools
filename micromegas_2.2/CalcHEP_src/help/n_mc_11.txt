  This function launches Simpson evaluation of
the total cross section. It is available only for
the 2->2 type of reaction. Convolution of matrix
element with parton distribution is not available
for this function. 
   Except of integral evaluation the subsequent
sub-menus allows the user to  set precision of 
integral evaluation and display a differential 
cross section as a function of cosine of the  
center-of-mass angle. Also this function provides 
the user with a possibility to display dependence
of total cross section as a function of any 
parameter  involved in evaluations.
