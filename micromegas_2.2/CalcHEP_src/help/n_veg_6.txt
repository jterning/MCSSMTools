 It launches Monte Carlo integration. The results
of integration are displayed on the screen and 
stored in files. 
  In general two cycles of  adaptive Monte Carlo 
program VEGAS are launched. In i-th cycle Vegas 
is called 'nSess_i' times with a permision to 
evaluate integrand 'nCalls_i' times.
   It is assumed that at the first cycle  Vegas
improves integration grid and can produce not valid
results at first steps. The user can see monitor 
the process of grid convergence via 'Error' column
on the screen.
  If nSess_2 !=0,  we forget all obtained results 
and start next nSess_2 Vegas sessions to obtain 
new  statistics. 
  The second cycle mainly is included for batch 
calculations. In interactive session the user can 
launch only the first cycle setting 'nSess_2=0' 
and using 'Clear Statistics' menu function.  
  If accuracy of integration is not sufficient,
the user can set 'nSess_2=0' and call 
'Start integration' again to continue Monte Carlo.
