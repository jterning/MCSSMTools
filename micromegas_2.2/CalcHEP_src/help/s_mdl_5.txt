2 9 76  External libraries and citations

  All lines of this table are concatenated and  passed to linker to 
collect n_calchep.  It need to pass to linker specific model functions
used in the list of constraints. 
  Other possibility is the including CERN PDFLIB parton distributions. 
In this case add the record 
 -L/cern/pro/lib -lpdflib804 -lmathlib -lpacklib
which  has to be corrected  according to  CERNLIB  disposition on your
computer.  CERNLIB contains is written in Fortran, thus one has to add 
to the link record system Fortran libraries like g2c. In general CalcHEP 
adds them automatically if they were found  at installation.

  Only parts of lines before the comment symbol % are passed to linker.
 We propose to use the commented fields  to pass information about papers
where the model was described and that should be used for citation.
