 1 4 52   Model menu  
   This is a list of available physical models.
Select a model for the further work. CalcHEP is 
distributed with 2 built-in models. They are SM
with full CKM matrix and version (SM') with 
diagonal CKM ( d' and s' quarks are used instead
of d and s). The Cabibbo angle is taken into 
account by modification of parton distributions
 with is switched on by PDG codes of d' and s' 
quarks.   
 
   Other  models are distributed separately and 
can be added to the list by means of the 
"IMPORT OF MODELS" menu function. Original 
versions of built-in models can be restored by the 
this  way too.
