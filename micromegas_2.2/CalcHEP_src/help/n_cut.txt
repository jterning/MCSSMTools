  This table  apples cuts on the phase space. A phase space function
 is described in the first column. Its limits are defined and the second
 and the third columns. If one of these fields is empty then a one-side
 cut is applied. 
  The phase space function is defined by its name which characterize 
 type of cut and a particle list for which the cut is applied. 
 For example, "T(u)" means  transverse momentum  of 'u'-quark; 
 T(u,D) means summary transverse momentum of quark pair.
 The following  cut functions are available:
  A  - Angle  in degree units;
  C  - Cosine of angle;
  J  - Jet cone angle;
  E  - Energy of the particle set;
  M  - Mass of the particle set;
  P  - Cosine in the rest frame of pair;
  T  - Transverse momentum P_t  of the particle set;
  Y  - Rapidity of  particle set. 
  N  - Pseudo-rapidity of particle set.
  Z  - Transverse energy
 Generaly 'A','C' have 2 arguments. But in case of  collision functions
 'A' and 'C' with one argument designate angle between the given 
 particle and first (in the list) incoming particle.
   One can construct cuts  using names  of particles which are involved 
 in others  subprocess. For a diven Monte Carlo session cuts which are
 applied for particles which are absensent in the session will be 
ignored.    
  
  Sometimes the list of outgoing particles contans identical ones
 like  in the case of "e,E->A,A,A" process. For such subprocess 
 E(A) cut  is applied to all  gammas. 

 One can add '^'/'_' modifier for function name. If process contains 
 identical particles such functions choose maximum/minimum values. 
In general cut 

 Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
E(A)        |   20        |  100

works like 

 Parameter  |> Min bound <|> Max bound <|
  E^(A)     |             |   100 
  E_(A)     |  20         |   
 
 One can type 'Jet' instead of particles name. CalcHEP  interprets 
 it as one of 5 quarks of gluon. 

 AM User defined cut also can be applied. They are specified by 
 'U<character_set>'. The list of particles is not expected after this
 name. CalcHEP will call use 
          usrfun("<character_set>")
 For example 
   'Uabc'   leads to call usrfun("abc")
 Originally CalcHEP contains a dummy version of 'usrfun' which leads to 
 stop of n_calchep execution. An object file or library with a code of
 usrfun has to be written in table 'Libraries' which specify the model.
 As well one can use the "Edit linker" option of CalcHEP symbolic
 session. The approach to particle momenta and their names needed to 
 write 'usrfun' are explained in CalcHEP manual.

 The parameter  limits van be defined  by an algebraic formula, which
 contains numbers and identifiers enumerated in the "Model parameters"
 menu. Parentheses  "()" and  operation "+,-,/,*,**,sqrt()" are also
 permitted.
