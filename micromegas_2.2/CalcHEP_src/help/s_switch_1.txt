2 2 50 Conservation low 
  If the switch is set "ON" then energy-momentum 
conservation low for incoming and outgoing 
particles is substituted at the level of symbolic 
calculation. Usually, but not always, it leads to 
more compact  expressions in comparing with the 
"OFF" setting.  
  In the time of numeric calculation   the 
conservation low is satisfied anyway.
