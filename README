This program calculates the spectrum of the Minimal Composite Supersymmetric Standard Model.
It was hacked by Csaba Csaki and John Terning, based on the code NMSSMTools by
Ulrich Ellwanger, John F. Gunion, Cyril Hugonie, C.-C. Jean-Louis, Debottam Das, and Ana M. Teixeira
for more information on NMSSMTools see
http://www.th.u-psud.fr/NMHDECAY/nmssmtools.html
For those familiar with NMSSMTools we have kept the same file names and structure.

HOW TO USE MCSSMTOOLS:


COMPILATION:
    
On Mac OS X you will need a modern fortran compiler, which can be downloaded 
from http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ .
To compile, type first "make init", then "make". A first compilation
may take a while, since all subroutines of micromegas_2.2 are compiled.
The following 8 executable routines are created in the directory
"main": nmhdecay, nmhdecay_rand, nmhdecay_grid, nmspec, nmspec_rand,
nmspec_grid, nmgmsb and nmgmsb_rand.
If a subroutine in the directory "sources" was modified, one has to
type "make init" and "make" again. If a routine in the directory "main"
was modified, it suffices to type "make" again.
To delete all the already compiled codes type "make clean".

INPUT FILES:

Any name is allowed for the input file, provided it
contains the three letters "inp"; it can be of the general form
PREFIXinpSUFFIX where PREFIX and SUFFIX can contain dots etc..

The input file can be located in any directory specified by a PATH.

To run any input file PREFIXinpSUFFIX, type "run PATH/PREFIXinpSUFFIX".
(PATH is optional; if absent, the input file has to be located in the
same directory as the script file "run".)

The output files are located in the directory specified by PATH.
They have the following format: 
If one single point in the parameter space is evaluated:
   PREFIXspectrSUFFIX, PREFIXdecaySUFFIX, PREFIXlhcsigSUFFIX and
   PREFIXomegaSUFFIX (if the relic density is computed, see below)
If scans are performed:
   PREFIXerrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXoutSUFFIX 

However, the task to be performed by an input file must be specified in
the BLOCK MODSEL at the beginning (see the SLHA2 conventions in 
B. Allanach et al., SUSY Les Houches Accord 2, arXiv:0801.0045
[hep-ph]).

The BLOCK MODSEL should contain the following four lines:

BLOCK MODSEL
	9	I3		# Call micrOmegas default 0=no, 1=relic density only
	13  I5               # 1: Sparticle decays via NMSDECAY

The meaning of the five integers I1, I2, I3, I4 and I5 is as follows:

      
I3=0: The dark matter relic density is not computed.

I3=1: The dark matter relic density is computed and checked via a call
      of micromegas_2.2. This option is not possible for GMSB-like
      boundary conditions. A first call of micromegas provokes the
      compilation of additional subroutines, which may take a while.
      
      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      relic density Omega*h^2 is given in the output files
      PREFIXspectrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXomegaSUFFIX. The latter
      contains in addition informations on the decomposition of the
      LSP and the relevant annihilation/coannihilation processes.
      The names of particles in the final states of the annihilation
      and coannihilation processes are the same as in micrOMEGAS and
      can be found in: G. Belanger, F. Boudjema, A. Pukhov and A. Semenov,
      micrOMEGAs: A program for calculating the relic density
      in the MSSM, Comput. Phys. Commun. 149 (2002) 103
      [arXiv:hep-ph/0112278].
      
I3=2: Same as I3=1 + direct detection cross sections are computed.
      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      BLOCK DIRECT DETECTION in PREFIXomegaSUFFIX contains:
      csPsi = proton  spin-independent cross section in [pb]
      csNsi = neutron spin-independent cross section in [pb]
      csPsd = proton  spin-dependent   cross section in [pb]
      csNsd = neutron spin-dependent   cross section in [pb]

I3=3: Same as I3=1 + the thermally averaged LSP annihilation cross section
      as well as the resulting photon spectrum are computed. In the case of
      a single point in parameter space (I2=0), these are written in the
      BLOCK INDIRECT DETECTION of PREFIXomegaSUFFIX:
      sigmaV = LSP annihilation cross section,
      dN/dx = photon spectrum from LSP annihilation. N is the nb of photons
      and x = log(E/M) where E is the photon energy and M the LSP mass.

I3=4: Same as I3=2+3.

Precision of the CP-even/odd/charged Higgs masses:

I4=0: 1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
              contributions ~ g1, g2, lambda and kappa to LLA
	      for the SM-like CP-even Higgs only
      2-loop: top/bottom Yukawa contributions to LLA
I4=1: as in G. Degrassi, P. Slavich, Nucl.Phys.B825:119-150,2010, 
      arXiv:0907.4682 (with special thanks to P. Slavich);
      corrections to the charged Higgs mass from K.H.Phan and P. Slavich:
      1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
              complete contributions ~g1, g2, lambda and kappa
	      (except for pole masses)
      2-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
I4=2: 1-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas
              complete contributions ~g1, g2, lambda and kappa
	      including pole masses (slow!)
      2-loop: complete contributions ~ top/bottom Yukawas

Sparticle total widths and branching ratios:

I5=0: Not computed

I5=1: NMSDECAY is called, which computes sparticle 2-body and 3-body
      branching ratios as in
      SDECAY: A Fortran code for the decays of the supersymmetric 
	 particles in the MSSM
      by M. Muhlleitner (Karlsruhe, Inst. Technol.),
        A. Djouadi (Orsay, LPT & CERN, Theory Division),
        Y. Mambrini (Orsay, LPT),
      Comput.Phys.Commun.168:46-70 (2005), hep-ph/0311167.
     SDECAY should be cited whenever NMSDECAY is used.
     In NMSDECAY.f in the directory sources, the flags 
        "flagmulti" (3-body decays)
        "flagqcd" (QCD corrections to 2-body decays)
        "flagloop" (loop decays)
     can be switched off; otherwise a call of NMSDECAY takes about 2-3 seconds
     per point in parameter space.
     In MCSSMTools flagqcd is switched off.
     In the versions nmhdecay.f and nmspec.f, the sparticle widths and BR's are
     appended to the output file PREFIXdecaySUFFIX in SLHA2 format. If scans are
     performed, the user can use the arguments of the COMMON statements in the
     subroutines OUTPUT in order to define the content of the output file.
